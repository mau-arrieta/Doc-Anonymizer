## MOTIVATION

In today’s digital age, the need to protect our personal and sensitive information has never been more urgent. Manual redaction is not only time-consuming but also prone to human error, making automated solutions a necessity. 

This project aims to develop a modular, deep learning-based system capable of detecting and anonymizing sensitive data and personal identifier information in scanned documents. By doing so, it seeks to create a practical, scalable tool for safeguarding privacy in real-world contexts like CVs, medical records, and administrative forms.
